# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (Rust)

Implementation of the great book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in Rust. 

Fun easy way to pick up and learn Rust (was roughly my first attempt at Rust, so please ignore the bad style such as lazily deriving Copy instead of borrowing properly), especially due to visual outputs improving as the codebase develops.

Above images each took ~ 3 hours to render.
